# Enable creating dynamic templated NGINX stream configuration files.
# Defaults will not produce a valid configuration. Instead they are meant to showcase
# the options available for templating. Each dictionary in the top level list/array represents a new configuration file.
# Unless otherwise noted, all variables are *strings* and *optional* (*required* values inside a dictionary are only required if the top level variable is defined).
# Most (not all) of these directives can also be used under the 'server' context, as briefly seen at the end of the below dictionary.
